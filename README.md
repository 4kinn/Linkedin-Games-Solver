# 🧩 LinkedIn Game Solvers

This repository contains JavaScript-based "Bookmarklets" to automatically solve LinkedIn's daily **Sudoku** and **Queens** games. 

The scripts are designed to work instantly without any browser extensions. They analyze the game board and visually overlay the solution.

2.  Right-click on the bar and select **"Add Page"**.
3.  **Name:** Enter a name for the button (e.g., `Sudoku Solver`).
4.  **URL:** Copy the code block below (for the specific game) and paste it into the URL field.
